        <p>This is the job description of Software Engineering position at Microsoft</p>
        <p>Microsoft Research provides a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers. Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.</p>
         <p>The Adaptive Systems and Interaction group at Microsoft Research AI pursues advances in principles of intelligence and interaction and applications of these advances to continuously improve computational systems. The team includes groups exploring foundations of sensing, learning, and decision making, search and retrieval, and human-computer interaction.

                The main focus of the internship project is building algorithmic methods and\or tools that can help machine learning practitioners in better understanding the performance of their systems along with failure conditions. Such methods and tools are beneficial not only for debugging and troubleshooting current existing systems but also for rigorously evaluating their performance and reliability and uncovering blind spots and biases models may have for different subgroups of inputs. The scope of the project also includes assessing the contributions towards real-world learning models and systems.
